Hello! I'm cryptina (Cristina) and I am currently learning as much as I can. I'm currently learning about the cloud, Python, security protocols and tools, and much more. 

I am excited to be a part of the tech field. It's ever-changing and it's an honor to be a part of history, as it's being every day in the tech world.
